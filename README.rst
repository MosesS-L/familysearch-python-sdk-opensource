familysearch-python-sdk-opensource
==================================

This is a reboot/spinoff of https://github.com/AmEv7Fam/familysearch-python-sdk-opensource, and hence a re-reboot of https://github.com/familysearch-devnet/python-fs-stack.

May or may not have all of the latest FamilySearch endpoints in place, but it is flexible enough to allow for additional endpoints

Made for Python 3. Python 2 is long past its EOL by now.

I don't have anything like a "to get started" yet.
