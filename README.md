familysearch-python-sdk-opensource
==================================

This is a reboot/spinoff of https://github.com/AmEv7Fam/familysearch-python-sdk-opensource, and hence a re-reboot of https://github.com/familysearch-devnet/python-fs-stack.

May or may not have all of the latest FamilySearch endpoints in place, but it is flexible enough to allow for additional endpoints

Made for Python 3. Python 2 is long past its EOL by now.

I don't have anything like a "to get started" yet.


## I'm Using GitHub Under Protest

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free, Libre, or Open Souce Software
(it fails all parts of FLOSS). I, like many others in the community, am deeply
concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop this FLOSS project.
I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host F[L]OSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, as training data or
as a source for output, is done without my permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use
of this project's code in Copilot.
